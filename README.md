# dungeon-adventures
General description
This project is a survival game where the ultimate goal of the player is to get out of the dungeon. 
A sequence of locations will be given and in each of them a player will have to overcome various tests.

User experience
There will be a team of four characters under the control of the player who have different abilities 
that should be used based on the current task. For example, some characters are able to fight, others are endowed with agility,
which allows them to get into areas inaccessible to others (jump, climb), someone can craft and etc.

Game development
The game will be created on Unity with using C# for PC. 
In the future it is possible to optimize and build applications for smartphones.
